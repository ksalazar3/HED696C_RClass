\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course has two foundational goals: (1) to develop core skills in
``data management,'' which are important regardless of which programming
language you use, and (2) to learn the fundamentals of the R programming
language.

Data management consists of acquiring, investigating, cleaning,
combining, and manipulating data. Most statistics courses teach you how
to analyze data that are ready for analysis. In real research projects,
cleaning the data and creating analysis datasets is often more time
consuming than conducting analyses. This course teaches the fundamental
data management and data manipulation skills necessary for creating
analysis datasets.

The course will be taught in R, a free, open-source programming
language. R has become the most popular language for statistical
analysis, surpassing SPSS, Stata, and SAS. What differentiates R from
these other languages is the thousands of open-source ``libraries''
created by R users. R is one of the most popular languages for ``data
science,'' because R libraries have been created for web-scraping,
mapping, network analysis, etc. By learning R you can be confident that
you know a programming language that can run any modeling technique you
might need and has amazing capabilities for data collection and data
visualization. By learning fundamentals of R in this course, you will be
``one step away'' from web-scraping, network analysis, interactive maps,
quantitative text analysis, or whatever other data science application
you are interested in.

Students will become proficient in data manipulation tasks through
weekly ``problem sets'' that you complete in groups of three. These
problem sets will account for 80\% of your grade for the course. Each
week class will begin with one group will leading a discussion of
challenges they encountered while completing the problem set. The rest
of class time will be devoted to learning new material. The instructor
will provide students with lecture notes, and also data and code used
during lecture. Therefore, student can follow along by running code from
their own computers.

\hypertarget{course-website-and-discussion-forum}{%
\section{Course Website and Discussion
Forum}\label{course-website-and-discussion-forum}}

\hypertarget{course-website}{%
\subsection{Course website}\label{course-website}}

Course Website can be found \url{https://ozanj.github.io/rclass/}.

In particular, we will use the ``Class Resources'' page
(\url{https://ozanj.github.io/rclass/resources/}) to post weekly lecture
slides (in pdf and .Rmd formats), datasets, weekly problem sets, etc.
Additionally, the ``Class Resources'' page will list required and
optional reading for each week.

\hypertarget{course-discussion-forum}{%
\subsection{Course discussion forum}\label{course-discussion-forum}}

We are using Piazza as our class discussion forum.

The Piazza website for our course is:
\url{https://piazza.com/ucla/fall2019/educ263/home}

Piazza is a learning forum where folks can customize questions/comments
to share with instructors or the entire class. Folks have the option to
insert code, images, videos, tables, links, and text to their Q\&A
posts. Additionally, posts can be configured to be annonymous.

All questions related to course content should be posted on the Piazza
discussion forum.

\hypertarget{communication-with-instructor-and-teaching-assistant}{%
\section{Communication with Instructor and Teaching
Assistant}\label{communication-with-instructor-and-teaching-assistant}}

Email me directly if you have a question regarding any personal issue.

Use Piazza discussion forums for all questions related to course
content. All students can then benefit from the response. Instructors
will aim to respond within 24 hours of your post Monday through Friday
and 48 hours on Saturday and Sunday. We may not be able to respond to
questions asked after Thursday at 12PM (problem sets due Friday at 12PM)

I encourage students to answer questions your classmates post on Piazza
discussion forums. Writing out explanations to student questions will
improve your own knowledge and will benefit your classmates.

\hypertarget{course-reading}{%
\section{Course Reading}\label{course-reading}}

Course readings will be assigned from:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Grolemund, G., \& Wickham, H. (2018). \emph{R for Data Science}.
  Retrieved from \url{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/} {[}FREE!{]}
\item

  The Definitive Guide}. Retrieved from
  \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/} {[}FREE!{]}
\item
  Other articles/resources we post
\end{itemize}

Required and optional readings for each week will be listed on the
``Class Resources'' page of the course website
\url{https://ozanj.github.io/rclass/resources/}

Please do the reading! I have worked hard to keep required reading load
light, focusing only on essentials, because weekly problem sets will be
time consuming.

The reading schedule works as follows: I lecture on a topic in class,
and then you do the reading about that topic and are required to
complete a problem set about that topic. However, if you would prefer to
the reading about a topic \textbf{prior} to me lecturing about that
topic, feel free to do so.

\hypertarget{required-software-and-hardware}{%
\section{Required Software and
Hardware}\label{required-software-and-hardware}}

\hypertarget{software-free}{%
\subsection{Software {[}FREE!{]}}\label{software-free}}

Instructions on downloading software can be found
\href{https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/educ263_todo.pdf}{here}

Please install the following software on your laptop

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R
\item
  RStudio
\item
  TinyTeX R package \emph{OR} MikTeK/MacTeX
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hardware}{%
\subsection{Hardware}\label{hardware}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bring in laptop with above software installed each week
\end{itemize}

Contact the teaching assistant beforehand if you cannot bring a laptop
to class and we will work out a solution if we can.

\hypertarget{assignments-grading}{%
\section{Assignments \& Grading}\label{assignments-grading}}

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Weekly problem sets (90 percent of total grade)
\item
  Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{weekly-problem-sets}{%
\subsection{Weekly problem sets}\label{weekly-problem-sets}}

Students will complete 10 problem sets (the last one due during finals
weeek). Problem sets are due by 12PM each Friday, right before we start
class.

Late submissions will lose 20\% (i.e., max grade becomes 80\%). Problem
sets not submitted by 12PM the following Monday will not receive points
because at that point we will post solutions on the course website. The
lowest problem-set grade will be dropped from the calculation of your
final grade.

Your will not lose points for late submission ff you cannot submit a
problem set due to an unexpected emergency. But please contact the
instructor by email as soon as you can so we can work out a plan.

In general, each problem set will give your practice using the skills
and concepts introduced during the previous lecture. For example, after
the lecture on joining (merging) datasets, the problem set for that week
will require that students complete several different tasks involving
merging data. Additionally, the weekly problem sets will require you to
use data manipulation skills you learned in previous weeks.

With the exception of the first problem set, students will complete
problem sets in groups of 3. We will form groups during class in week 2
and you will keep the same group throughout the quarter. However, each
student will submit their own assignment. You are encouraged to work
together and get help from your group. However, it is important that you
understand how to do the problem set on your own, rather than copying
the solution developed by group members.

Since you will be working together, it is understandable that answers
for many questions will be the same as your group members. However, if I
find compelling evidence that a student merely copied solutions from a
classmate, I will consider this a violation of academic integrity and
that student will receive a zero for the homework assignment.

A general strategy I recommend for completing the problem sets is as
follows: (1) after lecture, do the reading associated with that lecture;
(2) try doing the problem set on your own; (3) meet with your group to
work through the problem set, with a particular focus on areas group
members find challenging.

Finally, we strongly recommend using Piazza to ask questions you have
about problem sets. Note that you have the option to post a question
anonymously if you prefer. Instructors will do our best to reply quickly
with helpful hints/explanations and we encourage members of the class to
do the same.

\hypertarget{attendance-and-participation-10-percent-of-total-grade}{%
\subsection{Attendance and Participation (10 percent of total
grade)}\label{attendance-and-participation-10-percent-of-total-grade}}

Students are expected to participate in the weekly class meetings by
being attentive, supportive, by asking questions, or by answering
questions posed by others. Additionally, students can receive strong
participation grades by asking questions and answering questions on
Piazza.

Students are required to attend the weekly class meetings. Each
unexcused absence results in a loss of 20\% from your
attendance/participation grade. Three or more unexcused absences will
result in a failing grade for the course.

An excused absence is a professional opportunity that you discuss with
me beforehand or a medical, or family emergency. Excused absences will
not result in a loss of attendance points. However, you will be
responsible for all material covered in that class and you will be
expected to turn in homework assignments on time.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\hypertarget{classroom-environment}{%
\subsection{Classroom environment}\label{classroom-environment}}

With respect to the course material, learning programming and the
essential skills of data manipulation is hard! This stuff feels
overwhelming to me all the time. So it is important that we all create
an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and
talking about what they did not understand. Discomfort is part of the
learning process. Unburdern yourself from the weight of being an
``expert'' and just focus on improving, helping your classmates improve,
and helping your instructors improve.

With respect to classroom environment, let's work together to create an
environment that is relaxed, supportive, and where students feel
comfortable voicing any concerns they have. Be mindful that words and
body language affect people. Express your thoughts in a way that doesn't
make people feel excluded and does not make disparaging generalizations
about any group. As an instructor, I am responsible for setting an
example through my own conduct.

\hypertarget{online-collaborationnetiquette}{%
\subsection{Online
Collaboration/Netiquette}\label{online-collaborationnetiquette}}

You will communicate with instructors and peers virtually through a
variety of tools such as discussion forums, email, and web conferencing.
The following guidelines will enable everyone in the course to
participate and collaborate in a productive, safe environment.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Be professional, courteous, and respectful as you would in a physical
  classroom.
\item
  Online communication lacks the nonverbal cues that provide much of the
  meaning and nuances in face-to-face conversations. Choose your words
  carefully, phrase your sentences clearly, and stay on topic.
\item
  It is expected that students may disagree with the research presented
  or the opinions of their fellow classmates. To disagree is fine but to
  disparage others' views is unacceptable. All comments should be kept
  civil and thoughtful.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{academic-accomodations}{%
\subsection{Academic accomodations}\label{academic-accomodations}}

Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should
contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in
person at Murphy Hall A255. When possible, students should contact the
CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is
needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information visit

  UCLA policy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members
    including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for
    maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member
    of the University community, you are here to get an education and
    are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic
    endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating,
    plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the
    permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty
    are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal
    disciplinary proceedings.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This class

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Given that 90\% of course grade is based on weekly problem sets, the
    primary academic honesty concern that could come up in this class is
    copying problem set solutions from somebody else and passing this in
    as your own work.
