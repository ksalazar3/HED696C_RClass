### Logistics

__(LAST!) Lecture 14: Intro to GitHub__

- GitHub can be difficult to get the hang of! 

- Learning goals: Develop basic understanding; set up a repo on your local machine; get some practice working with GitHub

__Teacher Course Evaluations:__

- All but one completed as of this morning! 



### What we will do today

\tableofcontents

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Use this if you want TOC to show level 2 headings

#Use this if you don't want TOC to show level 2 headings
\tableofcontents[subsectionstyle=hide/hide/hide]

## What is Git and GitHub?

### What is Git and GitHub?

__Git__ is the most commonly used version-control system to manage code

- Save drafts of code 
- Look back at previous versions
- Undo mistakes
- Track your changes

\medskip
A project managed in __Git__ is called a __Git repository__

\medskip
__GitHub__ is the hosting site/service for __Git repositories__ 

- Stores your local repos in "the cloud"
- You can store files, share code, collaborate with others
- Who uses GitHub? Netflix, Airbnb, Lyft, Coursera 
- Competes with Microsoft's and Google's in-house systems

\medskip
This course is a __Git repository__!



## Git Setuup

We will setup Git using __Code Academy__ instructions: [Link](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/f1-u3-git-setup)


### Git Setup for Mac Users
 
1. Open a Terminal window (command+space bar to open Spotlight Search)

 - Terminal is the CLI (command line interface) for Linux and Mac users
1. Type in git to the command line and press enter
1. If you don't already have Git installed, you'll get an warning saying __Git__ requires command line developer tools. Click install and agree to terms.

### Git Setup for Windows Users
Warning: I have never worked/installed on a Windows so this may take some time! Mac Users please be patient :) 

1. Need to first install Git Bash

- _Bash_ is the default shell (a specific type of CLI) for Linux and Mac Users so only Windows users need to install this first. Windows default is _Command Prompt_.
- Download and intall Git Bash: [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Run the downloaded .exe file and allow the application to make changes to your PC. 
- Once it is finished install, check it installed by searching "git bash" in your start menu
- Click on the git bash icon to open your _Git Bash CLI_

### Setting Username and Email in Git
