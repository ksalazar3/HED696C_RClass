- Download the module2 Rmd and R script lecture files 
- Move the files to "rclass/modules/module2"
- Open RStudio via the ".rproj" file we created in class
- Once in R Studio go to File > Open File > navigate to and open the module2.Rmd
- Try knitting the module2.Rmd file (it will open an HTML document)

### What we will do in this module... {-}

- More introduction to R Markdown
- More R Basics
  - Using functions
- Investigating Objects
  - Variable names
  - View and print data
  - Missing Values
- Introduction to tidyverse
  - Select variables

  - Arrange rows

### Libraries we will use today {-}

"Load" the package we will use today (output omitted)
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
If package not yet installed, then you need to install before you load. Install in "console" rather than .Rmd file

- Generic syntax: `install.packages("package_name")`
- Install "tidyverse": `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Note: when we load a package, the name of package is not in quotes; but when we install a package, name of package is in quotes:

- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `library(tidyverse)`

# R Markdown

### What is R Markdown {-}

Borrowing from Darin Christensen:

- R Markdown documents embed R code, the output associated with R code, and text into one document
- An R Markdown document is a "'Living' document that updates every time you compile ["knit"] it"
- R Markdown documents have the extension .Rmd
    - can think of them as text files with the extension .Rmd rather than .txt
- At top of .Rmd file you specify the "output" style, which dictates what kind of formatted document will be created
- When you compile ["knit"] a .Rmd file, the resulting formatted document can be an HTML document, a PDF document, an MS Word document, or many other types

How we will be using R Markdown files in this class:

- Homework you submit will be .Rmd files, with "output" style will be `html_document` or `pdf_document`
- Lectures are .Rmd files, where we the output style will usually be an html document OR a `beamer_presentation` (PDF document, where each page is a slide)
    - Lectures are great examples to store and reference on how to use Rmd files

<!-- ### Creating RMarkdown documents -->

<!-- __Do this with a partner__ -->

<!-- Approach for creating a RMarkdown document.  -->

<!-- 1. Point-and-click from within RStudio -->
<!--     - Click on _File_ >> _New File_ >> _R Markdown_ >> _Document_ >> choose _HTML_ >> click _OK_ -->
<!--     - save the .Rmd file [any name, anywhere you can find it] -->
<!--     - "Knit" the entire .Rmd file -->
<!--         - point-and-click OR shortcut: __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k__ -->

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# 2. From blank text file
#     - create blank text file
#         - can give it any name, but change extension from .txt to .Rmd
#     - Open this blank .Rmd file in Rstudio
#     - copy this text into file [LINK HERE][PATRICIA CREATE LINK TO sample_simple_rmarkdown.txt FILE WHICH IS STORED IN LECTURE 2 DIRECTORY]
#     - "knit" the entire .Rmd file
#         - point-and-click OR shortcut: __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k__

#Don't worry about this. Ozan's notes
```

### Components of a .Rmd file {-}

An RMarkdown (.Rmd) file consists of several parts

1. __YAML header__
    - YAML stands for "yet another markup language"
    - Controls settings that apply to the whole document (e.g., "output" should be html_document or pdf_document, whether to include table of contents, etc.)
    - YAML header goes at very top of document
    - Starts with a line of three horizontal dashes `---`; ends with a line of three horizontal dashes `---`
2. __Text__ in body of .Rmd file
    - e.g., headings; description of results, etc.
3. __R code chunks__ in body of .Rmd file
```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- c(2,4,6)
a
a-1
```
4. __R output__ associated with code chunks
```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- c(2,4,6)
a
a-1
```

### Comment: Running R code chunks vs. "knit" entire .Rmd file {-}

Two ways to execute R commands in .Rmd file:

1. "Knit" entire .Rmd file
    - shortcut: __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k__
1. "Run" code chunk or selected lines within code chunk
    - Run selected line(s): __Cmd/Ctrl + Enter__
    - Run current chunk: __Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter__

Comment on default settings for RStudio:

- When you knit entire .Rmd file, "objects" created within .Rmd file will not be available after file compiles
- When you run code chunk (or selected lines in chunk), objects created by lines you run will be in your "environment" until you remove them or quit R session

### Output types of .Rmd file {-}

Common/important output types:

- __html_document__: R Markdown originally designed to create HTML documents
    - Most features/code in .Rmd files were written for html_document
    - Many of these features are available in other output types
    - When learning R Markdown, best to start by learning html_document
- __pdf_document__: Requires installation of LaTeX 
    - How it works:
        - You write .Rmd code; 
        - When you compile, this .Rmd code is transformed into LaTeX code
        - LaTeX "engine" creates the formatted .pdf file
    - Can include some of the same features available for _html_document_
    - Can insert LaTeX commands in .Rmd file with _pdf_document_ output
- __beamer_presentation__: Requires installation of LaTeX (we will knit a lecture Rmd into a beamer_presentation next week)
    - "beamer" is the name for presentations written in LaTeX
    - essentially creates PDF of presentation slides
    - Lectures for this class created with _beamer_presentation_ output
    - note: YAML header includes `beamer_header.tex` file, which creates some formatting rules and additional commands

# More R basics: functions 

## Introduction to using functions {-}

### What are functions {-}

\medskip __Functions__ are pre-written bits of code that accomplish some task. 

\medskip Functions generally follow three sequential steps:

1. take in an __input__ object(s)
2. __process__ the input.
3. __return__ (A) a new object or (B) a visualizatoin (e.g., plot)

For example, `sum()` function calculates or _sums_ the elements in a vector

1. __input__. takes in a vector of elements (numeric or logical)
2. __processing__. Calculates the sum of elements
3. __return__. Returns numeric vector of length=1; value is sum of input vector
```{r}
sum(c(1,2,3))
typeof(sum(c(1,2,3)))
length(sum(c(1,2,3)))

sum(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))
typeof(sum(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))); length(sum(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)))
```
### Function syntax {-}

Components of a function

- function name (e.g., `sum()`, `length()`, `seq()`)
- function arguments
    - Inputs that the function takes, which determine what function does
        - can be vectors, data frames, logical statements, etc.
    - In "function call" you specify values to assign to these function arguments
        - e.g., `sum(c(1,2,3))`
    - Separate arguments with a comma `,`
        - e.g., `seq(10,15)`
Example: the sequence function, `seq()`
```{r}
seq(10,15)
```
### Function syntax: More on function arguments {-}

Usually, function arguments have names

- e.g., the `seq()` function includes the arguments `from`, `to`, `by`
- When you call the function, you need to assign values to these arguments; but you usually don't have to specify the name of the argument
```{r}
seq(from=10, to=20, by=2)
seq(10,20,2)
```
Many function arguments have "default values", set by whoever wrote function

- If you don't specify a value for that argument, the default value is inserted
- e.g., partial list of default values for `seq()`: `seq(from=1, to=1, by=1)`
```{r}
seq()
seq(to=10)
seq(10) # R assigned value of 10 to "to" rather than "from" or "by"
```
### Function arguments, the `na.rm` argument {-}

When R performs calculation and an input has value `NA`, output value will always be `NA` [because NA= special value for "missing"; more on this later]
```{r}
5+4+NA
```

R functions that perform calculations often have argument named `na.rm`

- `na.rm` argument asks whether to remove `NA` values prior to calculation
- For most functions, default value is `na.rm = FALSE`
    - This means "do not remove `NAs`" prior to calculation
    - e.g., default values for `sum()` function: `sum(..., na.rm = FALSE)`
```{r}
sum(c(1,2,3,NA), na.rm = FALSE) # default value
sum(c(1,2,3,NA))
```
- if you specify, `na.rm = TRUE`, `NA` values removed prior to calculation
```{r}
sum(c(1,2,3,NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Help files for functions {-}

To see help file on a function, type `?function_name` without parentheses
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?sum
?seq
```

__Contents of help files__

- __Description__. What the function does
- __Usage__. Syntax, including default values for arguments
- __Arguments__. Description of function arguments
- __Details__. Details and idiosyncracies of about how the function works.
- __Value__. What (object) the function "returns"
    - e.g., `sum()` returns vector of length 1 whose value is sum of input vector
- __References__. Additional reading
- __See Also__. Related functions
- __Examples__. Examples of function in action
- Bottom of help file identifies the package the function comes from

\medskip __Practice!__

- when you encounter new function, spend two minutes reading help file
- over time, help files will feel less cryptic and will start to feel helpful




# Investigating objects

### Load .Rdata data frames we will use today {-}

Data on off-campus recruiting events by public universities

- Data frame object `df_event`
    - One observation per university, recruiting event
- Data frame object `df_school`
    - One observation per high school (visited and non-visited)

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # remove all objects in current environment

getwd()
#load dataset with one obs per recruiting event
load(url("https://github.com/ksalazar3/HED696C_RClass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_event_somevars.RData"))
#load("../../data/recruiting/recruit_event_somevars.Rdata")

#load dataset with one obs per high school
load(url("https://github.com/ksalazar3/HED696C_RClass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.RData"))
#load("../../data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.Rdata")
```


### Listing objects {-}

__Files in your working directory__

`list.files()` function lists files in your current working directory

- if you run this code from .Rmd file, working directory is location .Rmd file is stored
```{r}
getwd() # what is your current working directory
list.files()
```
__Objects currently open in your R session__

`ls()` function lists objects currently open in R
```{r}
x <- "hello!"
ls() # Objects open in R
```
### Removing objects {-}

`rm()` function removes specified objects open in R
```{r}
rm(x)
ls()
```
Command to remove all objects open in R (I only run this at beginning of my R scripts)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

### Describing objects, focus on __data frames__ {-}

\medskip __type__ and __length__ of a data frame object

- Recall that a data frame is an object where __type__ is a list
- __Length__ of an object is the number of elements
    - When object is a data frame, number of elements = number of variables

```{r}
typeof(df_event)
length(df_event) # = num elements = num columns
```
Number of __columns__ and __rows__ of data frame object

- number of columns = number of elements = number of variables
- number of rows = number of observations
```{r}
ncol(df_event) # num columns = num variables
nrow(df_event) # num rows = num observations
dim(df_event) # shows number rows by columns
```
`str()` provides compact information on structure any object (output omitted, show in R)
```{r, results="hide"}
str(df_event)
```

## Variables names {-}

### Variable names {-}

`names()` function lists names of elements in an object
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?names
```


When object is a data frame:

- each element is a variable
- each element name is a variable name

```{r}
names(df_event)
```
### Variable names {-}

Refer to specific named elements of an object using this syntax:

- `obj_name$element_name`

When object is data frame, refer to specific variables using this syntax: 

- `data_fram_name$varname`
- __Isolating variables is very useful for investigating data__
- This particular approach, i.e., using `$` is using base R to isolate variables [more next week]

```{r}
typeof(df_event$instnm)
typeof(df_event$med_inc)
```
### Variable names {-}

\medskip Recall that data frames are lists with following criteria:

- each element of the list is a vector
    - each element of the list is a variable; length of data frame = number of variables
```{r}
length(df_event)
nrow(df_event)
#str(df_event)
```

- each element of the list (i.e., variable) has the same length
    - Length of each variable is equal to number of observations in data frame

```{r}
typeof(df_event$event_state)
length(df_event$event_state)
str(df_event$event_state)

typeof(df_event$med_inc)
length(df_event$med_inc)
str(df_event$med_inc)
```

### Variable names {-}

Recall that object `df_school` has one obs per high school

- the variable `visits_by_100751` shows number of visits by University of Alabama to each high school
- like all variables in a data frame, the var `visits_by_100751` is just a vector
```{r}
typeof(df_school$visits_by_100751)
length(df_school$visits_by_100751) # num elements in vector
sum(df_school$visits_by_100751) #number of visited high schools of UAlabama
```
So we perform calculations on a variable, just like we would any numeric vector
```{r}
v <- c(2,4,6)
typeof(v)
length(v)
sum(v)
```

## View and print data {-}

### Viewing and printing data frames {-}

Four ways to view/print a data frame object

1. Simply type the object name (output omitted)

    - number of observations and rows printed depend on YAML header settings and on attributes (discussed next week) of the object
```{r, results="hide"}
df_event
```
    
2. Use the `View()` function to view data in a browser
```{r eval=FALSE}
View(df_event)
```
3. `head()` to show the first _n_ rows
```{r results="hide"}
#?head
head(df_event, n=5)
```

4. Click on data in environment to view data in browser

### Viewing and printing data frames {-}

`obj_name[<rows>,<cols>]` to print specific rows and columns of data frame

- particularly powerful when combined with sequences (e.g., `1:10`)

\medskip Examples:

- Print first five rows
```{r results="hide"}
df_event[1:5, ]
```
- Print first five rows and first three columns
```{r results="hide"}
df_event[1:5, 1:3]
```
- Print first three columns of the 100th observation
```{r results="hide"}
df_event[100, 1:3]
```
- Print the 50th observation, all variables
```{r results="hide"}
df_event[50,]
```

### Viewing and printing data

\medskip type `obj_name$var_name` to print specific elements (i.e., vars) in data frame

```{r results="hide"}
df_event$zip
```
- recall that these elements are vectors, with length = number of obs

```{r}
typeof(df_event$zip)
length(df_event$zip)
```

- `obj_name$var_name` syntax can be combined with sequences
    - vectors don't have "rows" or "columns"; they just have elements
    - so use sequence to identify which elements you want to print
```{r}
df_event$event_state[1:10]
df_event$event_type[6:10]
```

Can also print multiple variables using `combine()` function
```{r}
c(df_event$event_state[1:5],df_event$event_type[1:5])
```


## Missing values {-}

### Missing values {-}

Missing values have the value `NA`

- `NA` is a special keyword, not the same as the character string `"NA"`

use `is.na()` function to determine if a value is missing

- `is.na()` returns a logical vector
```{r}
is.na(5)
is.na(NA) 
is.na("NA")
typeof(is.na(NA)) # example of a logical vector

nvector <- c(10,5,NA)
is.na(nvector)
typeof(is.na(nvector)) # example of a logical vector

svector <- c("e","f",NA,"NA")
is.na(svector)
```

### Missing values are "contagious" {-}

What does "contagious" mean?

- operations involving a missing value will yield a missing value

```{r}
7>5
7>NA
0==NA
2*c(0,1,2,NA)
NA*c(0,1,2,NA)
```
###  Function and missing values, the `table()` function {-}

`table()` function useful for investigating categorical variables
```{r}
table(df_event$event_type)
```

By default `table()` ignores `NA` values

- `useNA` argument determines whether to include `NA` values
    - "allowed values correspond to never ("no"); only if count is positive ("ifany"); and even for zero counts ("always")"
```{r}
nrow(df_event)
table(df_event$event_type, useNA="always")
table(df_event$g12offered, useNA="always") #has some missing

```
Broader point:

- Most functions that create descriptive statistics have options about how to treat missing values
- When investigating data, good practice to _always_ show missing values

Tip: 

- command `str(df_event)` shows which variables have missing values
```{r results="hide", echo=FALSE}
str(df_event)
```



## Student Exercise {-}


Complete the following tasks using the `df_school` data frame

1. Use `obj_name[<rows>,<cols>]` to print the first 5 rows and 3 columns of data frame
1. Use head() to print first 4 observations
1. Use `obj_name$var_name[1:10]` to print the first 10 observations of the variable `name`
1. Use c() to print the first 3 observations of variables "school_type" & "name"
1. Use `table()` to print the number of missing observations (`NA`) for the variable `school_type`




# Investigating data patterns with tidyverse

### Introduction to the `dplyr` library {-}

`dplyr`, a package within the `tidyverse` suite of packages, provide tools for manipulating data frames

- Wickham describes functions within `dplyr` as a set of "verbs" that fall in the broader categories of __subsetting__, __sorting__, and __transforming__

Today | Next two weeks
------------- | -------------
__Subsetting data__ | __Transforming data__
- `select()` variables  | - `mutate()` creates new variables
- `filter()` observations | - `summarize()` calculates across rows
__Sorting data__ | - `group_by()` to calculate across rows within groups
- `arrange()` | 

All `dplyr` verbs (i.e., functions) work as follows

1. first argument is a data frame
1. subsequent arguments describe what to do with variables and observations in data frame
    - refer to variable names without quotes
1. result of the function is a new data frame

## Select variables {-}

### Select variables using `select()` function {-}

Printing observations is key to investigating data, but datasets often have hundreds, thousands of variables

`select()` function selects __columns__ of data (i.e., variables) you specify

- first argument is the name of data frame object
- remaining arguments are variable names, which are separated by commas and without quotes

Without __assignment__ (`<-`), `select()` function by itself simply prints selected vars
```{r}
select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc)
```

### Select variables using `select()` function {-}

Recall that all `dplyr` functions (e.g., `select()`) return a new data frame object

- __type__ equals "list"
- __length__ equals number of vars you select

```{r}
typeof(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))

length(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))
```
`glimpse()` function -- a tidyverse function for viewing data frames -- is a cross between `str()` and simply printing data
```{r}
#?glimpse
glimpse(select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc))
```

### Select variables using `select()` function {-}

With __assignment__, `select()` creates a new object containing only the variables you specify

```{r}
event_small <- select(df_event,instnm,event_date,event_type,event_state,med_inc)
glimpse(event_small)
```

### Select {-}

`select()` can use "helper functions" `starts_with()`, `contains()`, and `ends_with()` to choose columns 

Example:
```{r}
#names(df_event)
select(df_event,instnm,starts_with("event"))
```



### Rename variables {-}



`rename()` function renames variables within a data frame object

\medskip Syntax:

- `rename(obj_name, new_name = old_name,...)`
\medskip
```{r results="hide"}
rename(df_event, g12_offered = g12offered, 
       titlei = titlei_status_pub)
names(df_event)
```
Variable names do not change permanently unless we combine rename with assignment
\medskip
```{r results="hide"}
rename_event <- rename(df_event, g12_offered = g12offered, titlei = titlei_status_pub)
names(rename_event)
rm(rename_event)
```

## Filter rows {-}

### The `filter()` function {-}

`filter()` allows you to __select observations__ based on values of variables

- Arguments
    - first argument is name of data frame
    - subsequent arguments are _logical expressions_ to filter the data frame
    - Multiple expressions separated by commas work as __AND__ operators (e.g., condtion 1 `TRUE` AND condition 2 `TRUE`)

- What is the result of a `filter()` command?
    - `filter()` returns a data frame consisting of rows where the condition is `TRUE`

\medskip Example using data frame object `df_school`, where each observation is a high school

- Show all obs where the high school received 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) [output omitted]
- Results will only be saved if using assignment
```{r results="hide"}
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1)
df_school_berkeley <- filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1)

```

Note that resulting object is a list, consisting of obs where condition `TRUE`
```{r}
nrow(df_school)
nrow(df_school_berkeley)
nrow(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1))
```

- Create a filter to identify all the high schools that received 1 visit from UC Berkeley (110635) AND 1 visit from CU Boulder (126614)[output omitted] -->

```{r, results="hide"} 
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)
nrow(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)) 
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)) 
```


- Must __assign__ to create new object based on filter
```{r results="hide"}
berk_boulder <- filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, visits_by_126614==1)
count(berk_boulder)
```
### Filter, character variables {-}

Use single quotes `''` or double quotes `""` to refer to values of character variables

Below, we identify all private high schools in CA that got visit by particular universities
```{r results="hide"}
glimpse(df_school)
#Berkeley
filter(df_school,visits_by_110635 == 1, school_type == "private", 
       state_code == "CA")
#Bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 == 1, school_type == "private", 
       state_code == "CA") 

#Berkeley and Bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 == 1, visits_by_110635 == 1, 
       school_type == "private", state_code == "CA") 
```


### Logical operators for comparisons {-}

Symbol | Meaning
-------|-------
`==` | Equal to
`!=` | Not equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less than or equal to
`&` | AND 
`|` | OR
`%in` | includes

### Filters and comparisons, Demonstration {-}

Schools visited by Alabama (100751) and/or Berkeley (110635)

```{r results="hide"}
#universities visit some schools more than once
table(df_school$visits_by_100751)
table(df_school$visits_by_110635)
#berkeley and bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, visits_by_110635 >= 1) 
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 & visits_by_110635 >= 1) # same same
#berkeley or bama
filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 | visits_by_110635 >= 1) 
```
Apply `count()` function on top of `filter()` function to count the number of observations that satisfy criteria

- Avoids printing individual observations
```{r}
#Number of schools that git visit by Berkeley AND Bama
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 & visits_by_110635 >= 1))
#Number of schools that git visit by Berkeley OR Bama
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1 | visits_by_110635 >= 1))
```

### Filters and comparisons, >= {-}


\medskip Number of public high schools that are at least 50% Black in Alabama compared to number of schools that received visit by Bama
```{r}
#at least 50% black
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_black >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL"))
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_black >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL", visits_by_100751 >= 1))
#at least 50% white
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_white >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL"))
count(filter(df_school, school_type == "public", pct_white >= 50, 
             state_code == "AL", visits_by_100751 >= 1))
```
### Filters and comparisons, not equals (`!=`) {-}

Count the number of high schools visited by University of Colorado (126614) that are not located in CO
```{r}

#number of high schools visited by U Colorado
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1))

#number of high schools visited by U Colorado not located in CO
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1, state_code != "CO"))
#number of high schools visited by U Colorado located in CO
#count(filter(df_school, visits_by_126614 >= 1, state_code == "CO"))
```
### Filters and comparisons, %in% operator {-}

What if you wanted to count the number of schools visited by Alabama (100751) in a group of states (MA, VT, ME)?

We could use the `|` "or" operator
```{r}
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, state_code == "MA" |
               state_code == "VT" | state_code == "ME"))
```
Easier way to do this is with `%in%` operator
```{r}
count(filter(df_school,visits_by_100751 >= 1, state_code %in% c("MA","ME","VT")))
```

Select the private high schools that got either 2 or 3 visits from Bama
```{r}
count(filter(df_school, visits_by_100751 %in% 2:3, school_type == "private"))
```
### Identifying data type and possible values of variable is helpful first step for filtering {-}

- `class()` and `str()` shows data type of a variable 
- `table()` to show potential values of categorical variables

```{r}
class(df_event$event_type)
str(df_event$event_type)
table(df_event$event_type)

class(df_event$event_state)
str(df_event$event_state) # double quotes indicate character

class(df_event$med_inc)
str(df_event$med_inc)
```

Now that we know `event_type` is a character, we can filter values
```{r}
count(filter(df_event, event_type == "public hs", event_state =="CA"))
#below code would return an error because variables are character
#count(filter(df_event, event_type == public hs, event_state ==CA))
```





### Filtering and missing values {-}

Wickham (2018) states:

- "`filter()` only includes rows where condition is TRUE; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. To preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:"

\medskip Investigate var `df_event$fr_lunch`, number of free/reduced lunch students

- only available for visits to public high schools

```{r}
#visits to public HS with less than 50 students on free/reduced lunch
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", fr_lunch<50))
#visits to public HS, where free/reduced lunch missing
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", is.na(fr_lunch)))
#visits to public HS, where free/reduced is less than 50 OR is missing
count(filter(df_event,event_type == "public hs", fr_lunch<50 | is.na(fr_lunch)))
```

## Arrange rows {-}

### `arrange()` function {-}

`arrange()` function "arranges" rows in a data frame; said different, it sorts observations

\medskip
Syntax: `arrange(x,...)`

- First argument, `x`, is a data frame
- Subsequent arguments are a "comma separated list of unquoted variable names"

```{r, results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, event_date)
```
Data frame goes back to previous order unless you __assign__ the new order
```{r, results="hide"}
df_event
df_event <- arrange(df_event, event_date)
df_event
```
### `arrange()` function {-}

Ascending and descending order

- `arrange()` sorts in __ascending__ order by default
- use `desc()` to sort a column by descending order
```{r results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, desc(event_date))
```

Can sort by multiple variables
```{r results="hide"}
arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(med_inc))

#sort by university and descending by size of 12th grade class; combine with select
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(g12)),instnm,event_type,event_date,g12)
```

### `arrange()`, missing values sorted at the end {-}

Missing values automatically sorted at the end, regardless of whether you sort ascending or descending

Below, we sort by university, then by date of event, then by ID of high school
```{r, results="hide"}
#by university, date, ascending school id
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), school_id),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)

#by university, date, descending school id
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(school_id)),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)
```
Can sort by `is.na` to put missing values first
```{r}
select(arrange(df_event, univ_id, desc(event_date), desc(is.na(school_id))),
       instnm,event_date,event_type,school_id)
```


## Student Exercise {-}

Complete the following tasks using the `df_school` data frame

1. Use `select` to create (you must use the assignment operator) a new object called `df_school_v2` that only includes the following variables from `df_school`: `ncessch`, `school_type`, `name`, `pct_white`, `avgmedian_inc_2564`, and `visits_by_110635`
1. Use `filter` to create (you must use the assignment operator) a new object called `df_school_berkeley` that only includes public high schools (hint: `school_type`) visited (at least once) by UC Berekeley (hint:`visits_by_110635`) from the `df_school_v2` object
1. Use `arrange` to replace (you must use the assignment operator) the object called `df_school_berkeley` in a descending order for the percent of enrolled students that identify as White (hint:`pct_white`)
1. Use `head` to print the top 5 public high schools visited by UC Berkeley with the largest percent of enrolled students that identify as White
